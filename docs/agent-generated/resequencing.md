# Resequencing

The `hive_video.resequence` package repairs shuffled hive videos by detecting visual discontinuities, turning those discontinuities into source segments, ordering the segments, and rendering a captioned review video. The [package interface](package-interface.md) describes `hive-video resequence` and Python access. Cluster workers invoke these installed modules directly with `python -m`.

## Quickstart

Run the cluster commands from the `hive_video/` checkout on Sol. The default arrays process the established Start 04 side 1 and Start 47 sides 0 and 1 videos. Each `sbatch` below is a separate job: wait for it to succeed before submitting the next stage.

```bash
cd ~/workspace/honey-bee-behavior/hive_video

sbatch src/pipeline/slurm/resequence/download_raw_array.sh
squeue -u pdressla --iterate=120

# After the downloads succeed:
sbatch src/pipeline/slurm/resequence/resequence_stage1_array.sh

# Inspect qc/candidates.csv, qc/jump_events.csv, and
# qc/cut_review.proposed.csv. Create qc/cut_review.verified.csv only if
# you change the proposed cuts. Then:
sbatch src/pipeline/slurm/resequence/resequence_stage1a_review_array.sh

# Read review/auto_qc.summary.json. If it says manual_review_required,
# inspect review/qc_roll_flagged_joins.mp4 and record approval first.
# When it says auto_pass, or the flagged roll has been approved:
sbatch src/pipeline/slurm/resequence/resequence_stage2_array.sh
```

Stage 2 renders the full-fidelity MP4 and queues its dependent upload. The copy-and-edit sample launcher shows the complete dependency chain and current Sol resource allocations:

```bash
cp src/pipeline/slurm/resequence/resequence_pipeline_sample.sh \
  src/pipeline/slurm/resequence/submit_BATCH_e2e_v1.sh
```

The sample cannot submit unchanged. Replace its tracked plan literals, review and commit the copied zero-argument launcher, then run it with `bash`. It holds Stage 1a for source-cut inspection and Stage 2 for Auto-QC/manual approval. Its `--mem` values are total memory per allocation: download 4 GB, Stage 1 and Stage 1a 32 GB, serialized Stage 2 192 GB, archival upload 16 GB, compression 8 GB, and compressed upload 4 GB.

The current bounded unattended batch covers both top-panel sides of Start 03 (`20190608_181426`) and Start 38 (`20190722_200917`):

```bash
bash src/pipeline/slurm/resequence/submit_start03_start38_both_sides_top_e2e_v1.sh
```

This launcher requires a clean checkout published at `origin/main`, fixes all four locators and dependencies, and uses isolated pilot scratch and upload prefixes. Because it intentionally crosses the source-cut checkpoint without human inspection, its submission and Stage 1a outcomes remain pilot evidence. Auto-QC-cleared videos continue through rendering and maximum compression into the canonical archival and compressed inventory paths, while flagged videos file their compact review bundle and stop cleanly.

The earlier Start 01 / Start 02 integration pilot remains reproducible with its own fixed zero-argument launcher:

```bash
bash src/pipeline/slurm/resequence/submit_start01_start02_side0_top_e2e_v2.sh
```

## Where things live

- `src/hive_video/resequence/` contains reusable Python implementation and diagnostic modules, runnable outside Slurm.
- `src/pipeline/slurm/resequence/` contains all cluster orchestration for this workflow: job arrays, smoke tests, upload and compression jobs, and versioned parent launchers. Put additional resequencing Slurm scripts here.
- `data/qc/resequence/reseq_<key>/` contains selectively copied local review artifacts, organized into `qc/`, `segments/`, `order/`, and `review/`.

## Workflow details

On the cluster, the wrappers in `src/pipeline/slurm/resequence/` run the whole sequence and resolve every path from a single locator. Source cuts are inspected once; segment joins are sent to a human only when automatic QC flags them.

Stage 1 covers steps 1 and 2 below and prepares an editable cut table without writing hundreds of JPEGs. Stage 1a uses the inspected proposal directly, or `cut_review.verified.csv` when cuts were edited; it then covers steps 3 and 4 with the established trajectory-10 ordering. The automatic join diagnostic scores every chosen boundary. Clean videos pass without a second human loop; flagged videos receive a green-flash roll containing only the joins requiring review, and Stage 2 requires a report-bound approval. Stage 2 then performs the final render and upload. Completed steps and validated video parts resume safely after a wall-clock kill. Each remote video folder carries `CURRENT_ARTIFACTS.json`; the upload preserves older bucket objects for audit, but publishes the manifest only after payload verification, and only its listed files belong to the current validated run.

The fixed Start 01 / Start 02 pilot is intentionally different: it marks the unchanged source-cut proposals as `unreviewed_pilot`, files every Stage 1a outcome under a separate pilot-evidence prefix, and only lets auto-cleared videos continue. Those cleared archival bundles go to `resequenced/reseq_<key>/`, while their share copies go to `resequenced/compressed/reseq_<key>/<quality>/`. The v2 launcher also proves the manifest and actual media TLS paths with one-byte ranged GETs before submission; v1 remains the failed-attempt record. All published metadata keeps the `unreviewed_pilot` provenance explicit.

Compression is intentionally separate from resequencing: it creates a smaller H.264 sharing derivative while retaining the full-fidelity resequenced MP4. The smoke wrapper renders `high`, `medium`, and `low` samples before the array creates and uploads only the chosen full-length profile.

Optional smoke tests, compression passes, and the one-time five-video backfill are launched from the same directory:

```bash
sbatch src/pipeline/slurm/resequence/resequence_smoke_test.sh
sbatch src/pipeline/slurm/resequence/compress_qc_roll_smoke.sh
sbatch src/pipeline/slurm/resequence/compress_resequenced_smoke_test.sh
sbatch src/pipeline/slurm/resequence/compress_resequenced_array.sh
sbatch src/pipeline/slurm/resequence/compress_existing_low_backfill_array.sh
```

`src/pipeline/slurm/resequence/common.sh` holds the shared environment, the uv scratch-venv locking, and `hv_resolve`, which turns a locator such as `start47_side1_top` into the raw video path, the canonical key, and every work directory. The full walkthrough, including how to select other files, is in the [project README](../../README.md).

The rest of this document describes the underlying tools, which is what you want when diagnosing a bad join or running a step by hand.

## Underlying tools

The modules below live under `hive_video.resequence`; invoke a module with, for example, `uv run --no-sync python -m hive_video.resequence.detect_video_discontinuities --help`. The current pipeline is:

1. `detect_video_discontinuities.py` Compute frame-to-frame visual distances from a raw MP4. This produces ranked candidate cuts and, optionally, all frame-to-frame distances or candidate JPEGs (`--write-candidate-frames`).

2. `summarize_jump_events.py` Group adjacent high-distance frame pairs into discontinuity events. This separates single-frame cuts from short bursts of activity around a cut.

3. `build_segments_from_jumps.py` Build a segment CSV from selected discontinuity events. Diagnosed exceptions can be made reproducible with `--extra-cut-prev-frame`.

4. `order_video_segments.py` Compare segment endings to segment beginnings and write candidate joins plus a greedy segment order. The trajectory signature is the default choice for the 2019 Smith archive work.

5. `reassemble_video_from_segments.py` Render the ordered segments into a captioned MP4. This step is restartable: it writes part videos, skips completed parts, and checks `.safeword` between parts.

6. `compress_resequenced.py` Make a separately named H.264 sharing copy at one of three recorded CRF profiles. It validates resolution, frame rate, duration, and codec before atomically publishing the local derivative.

## Diagnostics

The `hive_video.resequence.diagnostics` package contains tools used to validate or review the pipeline rather than produce the final video directly.

- `diagnostics/diagnose_segment_discontinuities.py` Scores frame-to-frame distances inside specified source segments or source frame ranges. Use this to justify any forced cuts added to segment production.

- `diagnostics/make_join_review_video.py` Builds short before/after clips for candidate joins or filters an exact order to the joins listed by automatic QC.

- `diagnostics/auto_qc_segment_joins.py` Scores the exact chosen boundaries with the detector feature, ranks every possible successor, and emits a conservative video-level `auto_pass` or `manual_review_required` decision.

- `diagnostics/approve_manual_join_qc.py` Records a manual approval whose checksums are bound to one exact flagged auto-QC report, flagged table, review MP4, and caption manifest, and rejects stale approvals after any of them change.

## Safeword

Long-running, restartable scripts use `.safeword` in the current working directory. If the file contains `sea cucumber` or `seacucubmer`, processing stops cleanly between restartable units.

```bash
printf 'sea cucumber\n' > .safeword
```

Remove `.safeword` and rerun the same command to resume.

## Outputs

Production runs use one work root per source video on Sol:

```text
/scratch/pdressla/honey-bee/artifacts/resequence/reseq_<key>/
|-- qc/        detector results and cut-review tables
|-- segments/  source segment table and metadata
|-- order/     ranked edges and selected segment order
|-- review/    automatic join-QC reports and any flagged-join roll
`-- output/    full-fidelity render, mappings, metadata, and derivatives
```

The cleaned local review copies in `data/qc/resequence/` mirror the first four directories. A `qc/candidates/` JPEG directory may still appear in older runs; current Stage 1 creates those images only when `--write-candidate-frames` is explicitly enabled.

Large videos, compressed derivatives, and generated part files should stay out of git.
