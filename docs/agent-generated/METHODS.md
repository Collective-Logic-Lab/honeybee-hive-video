## HV-F001: Portable video fragment extraction

Status: adopted for issue #5 implementation, 2026-09-06.

Decision: the public `hive_video` fragment API takes explicit local source and output paths. Frame indices are zero-based and intervals exclude their stop index. Seconds use the nominal source frame clock: select indices from `ceil(start * fps)` through `ceil((start + duration) * fps)`, excluding the latter. A zero or omitted duration selects one PNG at `ceil(start * fps)`. Reject positive intervals containing no frames, incomplete intervals, and invalid rates; never clamp or substitute 25 fps. Inputs must report equal positive nominal and average frame rates. This metadata screen does not independently establish constant presentation timestamps; seconds denote the nominal frame clock, not absolute recording time.

Rationale and evidence: the repository seed and local resequenced Start 04 video both report 25 fps. Existing compression and review helpers change omitted-duration semantics, tolerate timing differences, or resize frames. A direct sequential FFmpeg frame-trim path gives an inspectable reference with exact ordinal selection. Tests will compare selected frame content and output frame counts on deterministic clips, including fractional frame rates and endpoints.

The derivative preserves stored pixel dimensions without automatic rotation. PNG uses decoded RGB; MP4 uses video stream zero, H.264 CRF 18, medium preset, yuv420p, and no audio. MP4 is a lossy viewing derivative. Existing media or sidecars are never overwritten. A JSON sidecar records source path/stat/probe, resolved interval, software identity, encoding settings, and the derivative checksum; it does not claim a whole-source content checksum. Shorthand selection requires an explicit search root and fails on multiple matching raw or resequenced copies.

Alternatives and sensitivity: timestamp seeking can be faster but requires equivalence checks before replacing the sequential reference. Rounding can change a boundary by less than one frame, and raw versus resequenced source choice changes chronology. Lossy encoding can affect pixel measurements. The full-source hash is omitted to avoid reading multi-gigabyte inputs solely for an ad hoc fragment; identified scientific runs still need their upstream immutable artifact records.

Affected scope: new fragment calls only; existing analysis, downloads, resequencing, and scheduled plans retain their methods. Revisit for variable-rate recordings, lossless analytical derivatives, measured long-video extraction costs, or a demonstrated need for audio or alternate geometry handling.

## HV-R001: Automatic QC for resequenced segment joins

**Status:** provisional production screen, 2026-07-26

**Decision.** Score each join in the proposed complete segment order before rendering captions or recompressing the video. The score compares the exact last source frame that the renderer will emit for segment A with the first source frame of segment B. It uses the same downsampled grayscale mean absolute pixel difference as `detect_video_discontinuities.py` and normalizes that distance with the Stage 1 whole-video median and scaled median absolute deviation:

$$
z_j = \frac{d_j - \operatorname{median}(d)}
{1.4826\,\operatorname{MAD}(d)}.
$$

The direct one-frame feature is deliberately distinct from the 10-frame, 96-pixel trajectory feature used to choose the greedy order. For every selected successor, the QC tool also scores every still-unused segment start that was available to the greedy algorithm at that ordering step.

A video is automatically cleared only when every selected join:

1. is the lowest-distance successor under the direct one-frame score;
2. has runner-up distance divided by selected distance at least $2.0$; and
3. has $z_j \leq 15.0$.

Any failed or unscorable join makes the video-level decision `manual_review_required`. Missing endpoint frames, an incomplete order, and a zero or invalid detector MAD must never produce an automatic pass. A manual review decision is a valid QC outcome rather than a software failure.

Before reassembly, the gate revalidates the report's source-video identity and the content hashes of the segment table, order, and detector metadata. When manual review is required, the approval records hashes of the report, flagged table, green-flash MP4, and caption manifest; changing any one makes the approval stale.

**Initial calibration evidence.** Three green-flash QC rolls were reviewed by the operator and all their transitions were judged clean:

- `start04_20190609_175013_side1_top`
- `start47_20190731_184423_side0_top`
- `start47_20190731_184423_side1_top`

Saved endpoint JPEGs first allowed an approximate retrospective check of 414 joins. Every approved successor ranked first. The smallest runner-up/approved distance ratio was $2.146$, the largest approved direct distance was $7.871$, and the smallest retained alternative distance was $13.170$. The original detector cutoff of $z=12$ would flag one approved Start 04 join, so the initial join-QC screen uses $z=15$ together with the independent rank and margin requirements.

The subsequent production raw-frame pass scored 420 joins across the same three videos: 142, 141, and 137 respectively. All 420 selected successors ranked first and all three videos received `auto_pass`. The smallest exact runner-up margin was $2.155743$, the largest selected direct distance was $8.013889$, and the largest exact robust score was $z=12.961261$. Thus the screen agrees with the human clean labels on these controls, but the controls still contain no known failed joins.

**Interpretation.** This procedure certifies that the reconstructed boundaries are visually smooth and unambiguous under the detector feature. It does not prove absolute chronology: a visually similar but chronologically wrong join can pass. Ordering remains the trajectory-based reconstruction, and auto-QC is a conservative shock/ambiguity screen over that result.

**Alternatives considered.**

- Reusing only the ordering cost was rejected because it would validate an order with the same feature that selected it.
- Reusing the detector's $z=12$ cutoff without calibration was rejected because it flags a known-clean join.
- Scoring the captioned final MP4 was rejected because changing caption text, resizing, and H.264 artifacts contaminate the boundary measurement.
- Treating the empirical score as a calibrated probability was rejected because the current labeled set contains clean videos but no naturally failed videos.

**Revisit when.** Re-estimate the thresholds at the video level after naturally failed joins have been labeled. Track both the fraction of videos sent to review and all observed false automatic passes. A higher manual-review rate is acceptable; evidence of a false automatic pass requires tightening or replacing the rule.

## HV-R002: Start 01 / Start 02 unattended pipeline pilot

**Status:** v1 failed before media transfer, 2026-07-27

**Decision.** Run one fixed end-to-end pilot on the top panel of side 0 for Start 01 and Start 02:

- `start01__20190606_190340_side0_top.mp4`, 32,148,912,998 bytes, MD5 `40f206a5c1cfb4367d0391038c4013e9`;
- `start02__20190607_184457_side0_top.mp4`, 32,129,316,234 bytes, MD5 `1f0c65e5ff5e4a4a91a3c053881e7fb7`.

This pilot intentionally lets Stage 1a consume the unchanged Stage 1 proposal without human source-cut inspection. That condition is recorded as `cut_review_status=unreviewed_pilot`; neither logs nor published metadata may describe those cuts as inspected. Because join QC cannot detect a source cut that Stage 1 missed inside a segment, an automatic pass remains a pilot result and not a human-validated inventory result.

Every Stage 1a outcome is published under the isolated prefix `resequenced/pilots/start01_start02_side0_top_v1/`. A `manual_review_required` video publishes its compact reports and flagged-join roll, then stops successfully without booking Stage 2. An `auto_pass` video continues through archival reassembly and verified upload, followed by the selected maximum-compression `low` derivative (H.264 CRF 28). Stage 2 tasks run one at a time because each requests 192 GB and performs heavy scratch I/O. Local work is likewise isolated under `artifacts/resequence_pilots/start01_start02_side0_top_v1/`; a bound root marker prevents a later generic compression or upload command from treating these unreviewed outputs as ordinary validated work.

**Interpretation.** The two-video run is an integration and yield probe, not a threshold estimate. The operator's prior expectation is that the present pipeline will clear more than half but fewer than 80 percent of the inventory without intervention; this pilot can reveal failure modes but is too small to estimate that rate.

**Revisit when.** Inspect both filed Stage 1a outcomes and every produced final video. Promote nothing from the pilot prefix into validated inventory until the source-cut limitation and any naturally flagged joins have been reviewed.

**Observed v1 outcome.** Revision `86cad78be24f81590ed47cd639c71ed76551a0f0` launched download array `59712692`. The cached manifest resolved both requested files, but the first actual media request failed TLS certificate verification because the tracked launcher did not carry the Sol CA-bundle setting used by the earlier successful downloads. The recorded `aftercorr` / `--kill-on-invalid-dep=yes` chain makes corresponding dependent tasks invalid rather than advancing them. The v1 scratch root, submission record, and empty-or-partial remote prefix remain the failed-attempt record and must not be deleted or reused.

## HV-R003: Verified archive TLS and Start 01 / Start 02 pilot v2

**Status:** tracked bounded retry prepared, not yet launched, 2026-07-27

**Decision.** Retry the unchanged Start 01 / Start 02 scientific plan as `start01_start02_side0_top_v2` from a new reviewed Git revision. The v2 parent pins Sol's readable `/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt`, and the downloader builds one verified TLS context containing Python defaults, certifi roots, available system roots, and any explicitly configured CA bundle. Hostname and certificate verification remain mandatory.

Before submitting Slurm jobs, v2 refreshes the Edmond manifest and performs a one-byte ranged GET for each selected media file. Each probe must follow the same HTTPS redirect path as a download, return HTTP 206 with a `Content-Range` total equal to the manifest size, and remain HTTPS. This tests both the manifest and large-media trust paths without downloading the videos on the login node.

v2 has disjoint local and remote roots:

- `artifacts/resequence_pilots/start01_start02_side0_top_v2/`;
- `resequenced/pilots/start01_start02_side0_top_v2/`.

Only `/scratch/pdressla/honey-bee/downloads/` remains shared. A valid `.part` file may resume there because the downloader verifies the final byte count and whole-file archive MD5 before Stage 1 can consume it. The v2 submission record binds the failed v1 job, prior revision and submission-record hash, TLS trust file, and retry reason. The validated v1 marker and full submission record are copied into v2's private `pilot_run/` prefix as retained prior-attempt evidence. v2 refuses to start while any v1 job ID is still active in `squeue`. Before each allocation is added to the dependency chain, the parent validates its numeric Slurm ID and publishes the next append-only `submission.step00.tsv` through `submission.step04.tsv` snapshot under the private v2 prefix. After all four IDs are recorded, it publishes and byte-size verifies the final `pilot_run/submission.tsv`, so scheduler provenance does not live only on scratch even if a later stage fails. The download array is submitted held and released only after that durable record is verified; if filing fails, no pilot compute advances under an incompletely recorded plan.

**Alternatives considered.** Disabling certificate verification was rejected. Requeuing v1 with an ad hoc environment override was rejected because it would change a launched plan without a new attempt record. Deleting v1's submission record or reusing its artifact prefixes was rejected because it would erase the distinction between failed and corrected attempts.

**Revisit when.** Revisit the CA selection only if Sol changes its system trust path or the verified media probe fails. Revisit the scientific plan under the same conditions recorded in HV-R002 after v2 produces filed outcomes.

## HV-R004: Start 03 / Start 38 both-side unattended pilot

**Status:** tracked bounded pilot prepared, not yet launched, 2026-08-07

**Decision.** Run a four-video end-to-end pilot on both top-panel sides of Start 03 and Start 38:

- `start03__20190608_181426_side0_top.mp4`, 32,135,449,433 bytes, MD5 `90944e39f3c88989c867d8ecd3037a69`;
- `start03__20190608_181426_side1_top.mp4`, 32,148,250,648 bytes, MD5 `38920d37de18b08ddcb8dae196b800dc`;
- `start38__20190722_200917_side0_top.mp4`, 29,847,838,843 bytes, MD5 `94c5dfd1b140be69b933db3806cb8272`;
- `start38__20190722_200917_side1_top.mp4`, 29,857,909,536 bytes, MD5 `c9909adb163a6942732ad9539e0263be`.

The fixed launcher is `submit_start03_start38_both_sides_top_e2e_v1.sh`. It refreshes the archive manifest, verifies each resolved canonical key, and probes all four real media redirects with TLS verification before submitting work. The corresponding download, Stage 1, and Stage 1a array elements use `aftercorr` dependencies. The Stage 2 gate is limited to one 192 GB task at a time.

As in HV-R002, Stage 1 proposals are deliberately labeled `cut_review_status=unreviewed_pilot`. Automatic join QC cannot establish that Stage 1 found every source cut, so the provenance and limitation remain explicit in every published result. Every Stage 1a outcome is filed; flagged videos stop with a compact review bundle, while cleared videos continue to the archival render and `low` (CRF 28, maximum-compression) derivative.

Scratch, submission records, and Stage 1a evidence are isolated under `start03_start38_both_sides_top_v1`. Cleared deliverables use the ordinary inventory layout: archival bundles under `resequenced/reseq_<key>/` and share derivatives under `resequenced/compressed/reseq_<key>/low/`. Separating these storage destinations is an organization decision, not an upgrade of the `unreviewed_pilot` validation status. The shared raw-download directory remains safe because completed files are size- and MD5-verified. The held download array is released only after the incremental submission record has been published and verified under the pilot-evidence prefix.

**Revisit when.** Inspect the filed source-cut tables and any flagged join rolls before treating canonical-path results as validated inventory. Record the four-video automatic-clear rate as additional yield evidence, not as a calibrated population success estimate.
