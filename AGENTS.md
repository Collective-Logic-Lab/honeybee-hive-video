# AGENTS_scientific.md

## Purpose

This is a reusable working contract for scientific-programming repositories. Adapt it to the project, place the resulting contract at the repository root as `AGENTS.md`, and keep project-specific scientific decisions in `METHODS.md`.

The objective is not production-software sophistication. The objective is a scientific procedure that another person can read, inspect, run, and criticize. Prefer direct code, explicit state, reproducible launches, informative failures, and auditable artifacts.

Use one root `AGENTS.md` wherever possible. Do not create parallel instruction files, hidden agent directories, or repository-local agent caches merely to support a particular editor or coding agent.

## Favored tools

This repository generally contains code written in Python. We (and by "we", we kind of mean "I") favor the following tools:

- `uv` + `pyproject.toml` + `.venv`
- The `gh` command line tool
- `ruff`
- `unittest`
- The Hugging Face CLI (`hf` or `uvx hf`)
- Zotero and Zotero MCP tools (for literature, citations, and DOI lookups)
- And, possibly, `pyrefly`

## Order of Work

Before proposing or making changes:

1. Read the root `AGENTS.md` completely. Do not begin by searching hidden agent-specific directories.
2. Inspect the repository status, current branch, and existing uncommitted changes. Treat changes not made for the current task as belonging to the researcher.
3. Read the project overview, `METHODS.md`, relevant tracked configurations and launch scripts, then the source and tests governing the path in question.
4. Inspect existing plans, manifests, and representative results when the request depends on prior experimental behavior.
5. Separate established method, observed evidence, interpretation, and an unresolved scientific choice.
6. Give a consequential unresolved choice a stable decision entry in `METHODS.md` before implementing it.
7. Implement the smallest complete and readable path, verify it in proportion to its scientific risk, and report exactly what was and was not run.

A tracked nested `AGENTS.md` is justified only when a subtree has genuinely different requirements that cannot be stated clearly in the root contract. Apply instructions from the root toward the target, with the nearest tracked file taking precedence. Do not use `.agents/`, `.agent/`, `.codex/`, `.claude/`, editor settings, or caches as a second source of project policy.

## Scientific Code

- Prefer clear, conventional scientific programming and generally accepted packages. Use NumPy, SciPy, pandas, scikit-learn, or another established package when its method is appropriate and can be stated plainly in a Methods section or appendix.
- Do not reimplement a standard estimator merely to avoid a dependency. Conversely, do not add a large dependency to replace a short, transparent calculation.
- Keep a small readable reference implementation of scientifically important operations. Check every optimized, vectorized, parallel, accelerator, or approximate implementation against it on deterministic fixtures before trusting results.
- Prefer a few direct functions and plain data structures. Use a standard abstraction such as a scikit-learn `Pipeline` when it makes the method more explicit. Avoid custom frameworks, registries, factories, plugin systems, inheritance trees, and generalized backends without a concrete second use.
- A little visible duplication is better than an abstraction that conceals the scientific procedure.
- Align code names with mathematical notation when the correspondence is real and documented, such as `x_t`, `x_next`, `delta_v`, `mu`, or `period_lambda`. Prefer descriptive names such as `neighbor_count`, `sample_count`, and `output_dir` when shorthand would be opaque.
- Document array shapes, dtypes, units, indexing and bit ordering, coordinate conventions, missing-data semantics, and the correspondence between symbols and code names.
- Comments should explain scientific meaning, assumptions, provenance, or invariants. Do not narrate obvious syntax.
- Make randomness explicit. Record the generator, seed, sampling procedure, and the point at which independent streams are derived.
- Treat numerical warnings and convergence failures as errors unless their handling has been reviewed and recorded in `METHODS.md`.

## Growing and Refactoring Pipelines

Build complicated systems gradually enough that the whole procedure remains comprehensible:

1. Start with one direct, end-to-end reference path on a tiny deterministic fixture.
2. Characterize the current behavior with focused tests and an inspectable artifact before changing structure.
3. Introduce one coherent seam at a time—for example, simulation, validation, serialization, scheduling, or transfer—and keep the data crossing that seam explicit.
4. Compare the old and new paths on the same inputs. Require exact equivalence where the method permits it; otherwise define the tolerance and rationale in advance.
5. Profile before optimizing. Preserve separate measurements for initialization, steady-state compute, validation, serialization, storage, and transfer.
6. Add multiprocessing, cluster scheduling, or acceleration only after the single-process reference path is correct and measured.
7. Remove superseded code only after the replacement is verified. Do not leave two ambiguous production paths or a permanent compatibility framework.

Keep scientific logic, artifact I/O, and operational orchestration visibly separable, but do not turn that separation into a framework. A reader should be able to follow a sample from explicit input, through each transformation, to validated output without consulting a registry or reconstructing hidden state.

Prefer inspectable intermediate artifacts when they mark scientifically useful boundaries. Name their schema and provenance, validate them on write and read, and checksum material outputs. Do not add intermediates merely because an orchestration layer makes them convenient.

## Explicit Inputs and Outputs

- Do not provide implicit defaults for experimental or scientifically consequential parameters, random seeds, datasets, output locations, run IDs, artifact prefixes, overwrite behavior, or backup requirements.
- Require consequential settings in a tracked configuration. Scheduled experiments and calibrations use the zero-argument launch contract below.
- Defaults are acceptable for inconsequential interface settings when they improve usability. Preserve every resolved setting in the run manifest.
- For third-party estimators, record the package version and the complete resolved parameter set; do not assume library defaults remain stable.
- Validate the complete configuration before compute begins. Materialize the resolved configuration and planned outputs without silently substituting a path, implementation, device, dataset, or parameter.
- Refuse to write into a completed or unexpected nonempty output directory. Overwrite and restart-from-scratch are distinct, explicit operations.
- Never emit placeholder, empty, synthetic, or default scientific results in response to missing input or failed computation.

## Errors and Failure Semantics

- Fail loudly and near the source. Error text should identify the failed condition, expected value, observed value, and relevant run, unit, sample, or path.
- Use ordinary exceptions such as `ValueError`, `FileNotFoundError`, and `RuntimeError`. Do not create a custom exception hierarchy without a demonstrated need.
- Do not use `assert` for configuration, input, or data validation; assertions can be disabled.
- Do not silently catch exceptions, drop records, skip inputs, replace invalid values, retry operations, or fall back to another implementation or device.
- A top-level handler may record failure context and preserve validated partial artifacts, but it must retain the original nonzero outcome.
- Scientific terminal states such as extinction, recurrence, censoring, or an operator stop are explicit data statuses. Software failures remain failures.
- A failed unit may preserve an error manifest and validated partial output, but it is not complete. Aggregation must verify expected coverage, schemas, and checksums and refuse incomplete inputs.
- If a retry is scientifically and operationally justified, make it an explicit method decision. Give each attempt its own record and retain failed attempts.

## Method and Reproduction Record

`METHODS.md` is the living scientific and reproduction decision record. Before implementing a consequential ambiguous choice, give it a stable decision ID and record:

- the question and decision;
- its status and date;
- the rationale and evidence;
- plausible alternatives;
- likely sensitivity;
- affected configurations and runs; and
- the condition under which the decision should be revisited.

Supersede decisions explicitly after runs depend on them. Do not silently edit history into apparent certainty.

Every run must preserve its resolved configuration, seeds, code revision, dependency versions and lockfile identity, environment, hardware, thread settings, data selection, timestamps, and local and remote artifact locations. Keep raw results auditable and derive summaries or training views from identified run-level artifacts.

Predefine reproduction criteria before expensive sweeps. Comparable results require comparable data, axes, metrics, termination rules, and regimes—not merely similar plots.

## MacBook, Sol, and Hugging Face

Treat the three surfaces as having distinct roles.

### MacBook: source, review, and analysis

- Use the MacBook checkout for readable development, documentation, focused tests, tiny deterministic runs, plan construction, review, and analysis.
- Git is the authority for code, configurations, launchers, tests, and method records. Commit dependency locks and small deterministic fixtures.
- Keep generated corpora, checkpoints, and bulk metrics outside the source checkout. Do not make an untracked local result the only record of a scientific run.
- Review the exact revision and immutable plan before sending work to Sol.

### Sol (`sol.asu.edu`): scheduled compute

- Keep a clean clone of the reviewed revision on Sol. Do not develop divergent, untracked scientific code directly on the cluster.
- Use login nodes for synchronization, planning, submission, monitoring, and light inspection only. Run substantive compute through Slurm.
- Prepare and pin the environment before the sweep, for example with `uv sync --frozen`. Concurrent jobs must not install packages or mutate a shared checkout or environment.
- Use cluster scratch for per-run staging and compute output. Give concurrent units disjoint directories and treat scratch as working storage, never the sole durable copy.
- Record the actual Slurm job IDs, nodes, environment, and observed resources as run outputs.
- For this researcher's account, monitor the full job surface with `squeue -u pdressla --iterate=10`, then use `sacct` for completed-job resource and outcome records.

### Private Hugging Face storage: durable large artifacts

- Use an explicitly approved private Hugging Face Bucket or repository for finalized corpora, checkpoints, bulk metrics, run exports, and backup verification records.
- Every project launcher must name the exact private destination and a run-specific immutable prefix in the `peterdresslar` namespace.
- Prepare and pin the `hf` client before scheduled work. Preflight its version, authenticated identity, destination privacy, and target-prefix state.
- Credentials are never committed, printed, embedded in launch commands, or written to manifests and logs.
- Construct and inspect an allowlisted upload plan. Sync only finalized artifacts, do not use routine remote deletion, and do not silently retry.
- Record the remote listing or version after upload. Download into a fresh verification directory and compare the expected manifest and checksums before declaring backup complete.
- Hugging Face storage is the authority for large run artifacts, not for source code. Git remains the authority for the program and method.

The ordinary flow is:

```text
MacBook reviewed code and plan
    -> Git revision
    -> clean Sol checkout and Slurm compute
    -> finalized scratch export
    -> private Hugging Face destination
    -> fresh checksum verification
    -> selective retrieval to the MacBook for analysis
```

An ad hoc `scp` copy can help with diagnosis, but it is not a substitute for the named, verified artifact path.

## Reproducible Scheduled Launches

- Every scheduled experiment or calibration has one tracked, versioned parent launch script with a zero-argument invocation, such as `bash generations/submit_example_v1.sh`.
- Do not permit invocation-time positional arguments, flags, environment assignments, or shell prefixes to select consequential settings.
- Make the parent script the visible source of every operational input: configuration, run and plan IDs, revision, interpreter, account, partition, QoS, nodes, tasks, CPUs, GPUs, memory, wall time, concurrency, thread limits, scratch, logs, output and control paths, restart policy, and backup mode and destination.
- A parent may derive its repository root from its tracked location and pass resolved values internally to `sbatch` or a worker. Reject inherited `SBATCH_*` variables and analogous environment overrides.
- A worker that bypasses the parent must fail rather than launch with partial settings.
- Changing a launch setting requires a reviewed tracked edit. Once a plan is launched, any revision receives a new script or configuration version, plan ID, and run ID. Do not use `sbatch` command-line overrides to revise a recorded experiment.
- Scheduler-assigned identifiers and observed node metadata are outputs, not launch inputs.
- Credentials are the only exception to embedding resolved values. The parent must still name and preflight the authentication mechanism and destination.

## Staged Experiment Operations

Scale through explicit stages:

1. plan-only validation;
2. minimal local and scheduled smoke tests;
3. wall-time, memory, and storage calibration;
4. forced-failure and restart or finalization test;
5. bounded pilot;
6. authorized production run or sweep.

A plan-only stage validates and writes the complete immutable plan, including stable unit IDs, seeds, configurations, array bounds, and expected outputs. It does not allocate expensive hardware, construct the full dataset, or transfer bulk artifacts.

Treat calibration as data. Measure initialization and warm-up separately from steady-state compute, validation or recurrence overhead, serialization, checkpointing, backup, peak memory, and storage. Use measured results—not intuition alone—to choose resources, wall time, checkpoint cadence, and concurrency.

Use the same direct experiment entry point locally and under Slurm. Bound processes and numerical-library threads to the requested allocation, and cap array concurrency for responsible fair-share use.

## State, Finalization, and Transfer

- Give each unit a disjoint staging directory. Avoid shared mutable state by construction.
- Persist validated unit results as they finish. Write manifests, state, and completion markers through a temporary path followed by atomic replacement.
- Resume only from validated checkpoints. Skip only units whose exact expected outputs and checksums are complete.
- Long units emit a timestamped heartbeat at an explicit interval with the unit ID, completed and planned work, throughput, and latest checkpoint state.
- Use one visible file-based operator control with a small vocabulary recorded in `METHODS.md`. Keep a requested action sticky and check it at a declared scientifically atomic boundary.
- Use one straightforward finalization path for success, censoring, operator stop, failure, and scheduler termination. Preserve the latest valid state and the original outcome.
- Record computation, export, upload, and verification as separate outcomes. Backup success must never convert failed science into a successful run.

For long production runs, prefer separate compute and transfer allocations. Let compute use its scientific wall-time budget, then invoke a dependent finalizer or transfer job with resources appropriate to checksum, compression, network transfer, and fresh verification. The transfer job must run after both successful and failed compute so that it can preserve valid state, while retaining the compute outcome independently.

## Git, Local State, and Worktrees

- Keep GitHub focused on code, small fixtures, tracked configurations, tests, manifests, and documentation. Store bulk generated artifacts in the approved private artifact store.
- Preserve unrelated dirty changes. Never discard, overwrite, stage, or commit another person's work merely to obtain a clean tree.
- Prefer the existing checkout and an ordinary reviewed branch.
- Treat worktrees as a last resort. Use one only for genuinely simultaneous or incompatible branch work that cannot be handled safely in the current checkout—not to evade a dirty tree or avoid understanding existing changes.
- Before creating a worktree, inspect existing worktrees, branches, ownership, and target paths. Keep it outside the repository's source tree and document why it is needed.
- Do not remove a worktree or branch, or delete its unmerged contents, without explicit approval.
- Scheduled runs still require a clean, immutable checkout at the reviewed revision; a worktree does not weaken that rule.
- Do not commit local editor metadata, agent state, caches, credentials, or machine-specific paths. Use the single root `AGENTS.md` as the shared agent contract and keep tool-specific state outside the repository when possible.
- Do not ignore dependency lockfiles. They are scientific provenance.

## Verification

- Add focused tests for scientific invariants, explicit failures, and the changed path. Prefer small deterministic fixtures whose expected states can be inspected directly.
- Check optimized implementations against the reference implementation on supported shapes and boundary cases.
- Test missing parameters, unexpected shapes, nonempty outputs, corrupted checkpoints, forced interruption, incomplete aggregation, and failed backup verification when those paths are relevant.
- Test the direct entry point before its wrapper, and test the wrapper before a scheduled launch.
- Do not launch costly compute, training, uploads, or large downloads without explicit authorization.
- Report the commands run, their outcomes, and important checks not run.

## Writing and Communication

- Lead with findings, decisions, and concrete evidence. Distinguish reproduced results from interpretation.
- Surface uncertainty, failed assumptions, warnings, and source discrepancies. Do not smooth them into confident prose.
- Preserve harmless authorial idiosyncrasies. Change them only when they harm factual accuracy, clarity, or reproducibility.
- Questions, placeholders, contrasts, and rejected alternatives in internal discussion should guide reasoning; finished prose should normally state the resolved fact directly.
- Use dollar-delimited LaTeX: `$...$` inline and `$$...$$` for display math.
- Keep edits narrow and leave unrelated prose, code, formatting, and metadata alone.
- Do not use bold lead-ins in lists (avoid the `- **Item**: description` pattern); write plain list entries.
- Do not insert hard line breaks or manually wrap lines within Markdown paragraphs; write paragraphs as continuous lines and rely on editor soft-wrapping.
- Ask before destructive operations, broad refactors, substantial compute or transfer expenditure, publication, or changes to scientific scope.

## Publication and Security

- Do not publish data, checkpoints, results, or external artifacts without explicit approval.
- Never commit secrets. Treat `.gitignore` as noise control, not as a security boundary.
- Record private artifact locations without recording credentials.
- Before any public release, review the intended files, manifests, licensing, privacy, and scientific claims as a separate authorized step.
